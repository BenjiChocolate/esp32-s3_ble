 ESP32-S3 BLE Sender & Receiver

This repository contains simple **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** examples for the **ESP32-S3**, demonstrating basic BLE communication using **ESP-IDF**.

The project is split into two main examples:
- **Sender** – advertises BLE data
- **Receiver** – scans and receives BLE data

This repo is intended as a **starter template** for learning and building BLE projects on the ESP32-S3.
